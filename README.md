# Gigaclear Coding Challenge

A coding challenge to write a Python program that loads a .graphml file and then outputs the correct costs for two contractors, based on their rate cards. My solution was developed in a Docker container and makes use of the NetworkX Python package to analyse the supplied Graph file and make the required calculations.
